Still fully trying to wrap my head around what it adds capability wise that couldn't be done without it but at minimum, it reducesLainnya the cost of using the API by 90%.

I did take advantage of using chat GPT to help me create a messenger app to message between the user and GPT versus the search interface I had before. You still have to update the assistant to be knowledgeable of previous conversations so that it can maintain a consistent, coherent and elongated conversation.

But what I thought was pretty cool is the fact that I had never developed a full stack application by myself before 6 weeks or so ago and I developed this chat application in a single day now using the knowledge I have gained and the proficiency that I have established using chat GPT to code websites.

I still have a few things I need to fix on it but here is a quick screenshot of the app.ᴣᴣᴣChatGPT|჻|https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/332030348_3043782379249901_273877116290632271_n.jpg?stp=cp0_dst-jpg_e15_fr_q65&_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5bac3a&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&_nc_ohc=s7WSGilgW9UAX8aTMze&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.xx&oh=00_AfDRHwlYk6cSjU5SgnqOYrl_65HtjFaT670sqGPjiRA9CQ&oe=640A7F67&manual_redirect=1|჻|Today I got notification that Bing's mobile app now does AI too (not just the desktop browser as before)ᴣᴣᴣ
